1.Our app is about a diary  or note book type app.This app keeps a record of daily health measurement lists and show date and time of any new record added to the bottom of list.It uses firebase to keep user information like username firstname ,lastname,password.In login page  a user gets entry to a new measurement page.there he/she can insert systolic diastolic,pulse rate .
2.These lists are shown in a measurement list .whenever a new measurement is added ,that list is added to the bottom of the list.
3.user can edit or delete a a list.
4.records are added according to date and time whenever an user  records an item.
5.At first we added login pages to our app using linear layout then android constrain layout was used but we faced a problem going to another activity from an activity if we use linear layout and constraint layout so we had to truncate login and signup page.It can be said signup login pages were done with realtime database using firebase.
